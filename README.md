Current TODO for project content

Create basic web interface html page
    this will need to use some form of CSS (which may be able to be downloaded/derived from Alessios basic)
    It can be largely based on the index.html from the boilerplate (and will need to use some of the JS from the envy.js file)
    will probably need to establish a server.js file as well

Website functionality
    Connect to a mysqlDB which will be designed quickly for storage of carparks, floors, and so on
    pathfinding can come later

Currently unnecessary files
    

Build assets folder
